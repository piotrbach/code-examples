  Compatible with: Umbraco 8

  Description:
    This SQL script audits media items in Umbraco 8 with selected file extensions,
    identifying large files and potentially corrupted ones (with 0 or NULL size).
    It calculates file sizes, flags large files using a configurable threshold,
    and isolates the latest version per media item.

  Features:
    - Filters by extension (e.g., .tiff, .ai, .webp)
    - Computes size in bytes and megabytes
    - Flags:
        â€¢ IsLargeFile (based on @LargeFileThreshold)
        â€¢ IsCorrupted (size missing or zero)
    - Helps with content cleanup and performance tuning
